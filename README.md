# Intrapartum Fetal Continuous Cardiotocography Dataset with Gold Standard Acceleration and Deceleration Annotations 

A preprocessed Intrapartum Fetal Continuous Cardiotocography (Fetal-CTG) Dataset, complete with gold standard acceleration and deceleration annotations, is available alongside the original research article titled "Multi-modal Multi-scale Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Recognizing Acceleration and Deceleration Graphs in Intrapartum Fetal Continuous Cardiotocography." 

In total, the dataset encompasses 2,944 pages with annotations for three classes: background, acceleration, and deceleration. The dataset includes 4,018 acceleration and 2,805 deceleration events.
